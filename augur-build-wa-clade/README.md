## WA clade analysis

Analysis of the predominant Washington State outbreak clade in Figure 2 of the manuscript can be produced by running `snakemake` from this directory. This will produce the file `auspice/ncov.json`, which can be visualized with Auspice. This file has been copied over to `ncov-cryptic-transmission/auspice/ncov-cryptic-transmission_wa-clade.json`. An interactive visualization of analysis results can be found at [https://nextstrain.org/community/blab/ncov-cryptic-transmission/wa-clade](nextstrain.org/community/blab/ncov-cryptic-transmission/wa-clade).
