## Introduction analysis

Analysis of introductions to Washington State in Figure 1 of the manuscript can be produced by running `snakemake -s Snakefile_Regions` from this directory. This will produce the file `auspice/ncov_washington.json`, which can be visualized with Auspice. This file has been copied over to `ncov-cryptic-transmission/auspice/ncov-cryptic-transmission_introductions.json`. An interactive visualization of analysis results can be found at [https://nextstrain.org/community/blab/ncov-cryptic-transmission/introductions](nextstrain.org/community/blab/ncov-cryptic-transmission/introductions).
