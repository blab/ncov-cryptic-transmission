# phyTreeFromTransTree

phyTreeFromTransTree downsamples a complete transmission tree (provided as an edgelist of who infected whom and when) into a bifurcating phylogenetic tree. 

The main function is samplePhyloTree.m, and you can step through a demo with buildExample.m.  Pretty plots are generateed using ggplotPhyloTree.R (which can be called from the command line or with a matlab wrapper).
