# observeTransTree

observeTransTree provides tools to implement a complex sampling strategy based on metadata generated by augmentTransTree.m. Given a sample size, set of time constraints, and probabilities of sampling based on attributes, it generates a list of sampled nodes from linelists formatted as from augmentTransTree.
